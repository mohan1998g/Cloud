Performing reconciliation after extraction from multiple sources such as S3, Snowflake (SF), and WebAPI in PySpark jobs involves comparing the extracted data with the expected data to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Hereâ€™s a systematic approach to reconciliation in PySpark jobs:

1. Define Reconciliation Criteria
Before performing reconciliation, you need to establish the metrics or criteria by which the reconciliation will be performed. Some common criteria include:

Row count comparison: Ensure the number of records from each source matches expectations.
Field-level comparison: Check that key fields (e.g., IDs, timestamps) match across sources.
Null/invalid data checks: Identify records with missing or invalid data.
Duplicate detection: Ensure no duplicate records were extracted.
2. Perform Row Count Validation
After loading data from each source into DataFrames, compare the row counts to ensure that the number of extracted records matches the expected number.

python
Copy code
# Example: Row count validation for S3, SF, and WebAPI
s3_count = df_s3.count()
sf_count = df_sf.count()
webapi_count = df_webapi.count()

print(f"S3 Record Count: {s3_count}")
print(f"SF Record Count: {sf_count}")
print(f"WebAPI Record Count: {webapi_count}")

# Compare counts
if s3_count == expected_s3_count and sf_count == expected_sf_count and webapi_count == expected_webapi_count:
    print("Row count validation passed.")
else:
    print("Row count mismatch!")
3. Key Field Comparison
Perform field-level reconciliation by comparing primary key fields across sources to ensure data integrity.

python
Copy code
# Assuming 'id' is the key field to compare
s3_ids = df_s3.select("id").distinct()
sf_ids = df_sf.select("id").distinct()
webapi_ids = df_webapi.select("id").distinct()

# Compare differences between IDs
missing_in_s3 = sf_ids.subtract(s3_ids)
missing_in_sf = s3_ids.subtract(sf_ids)
missing_in_webapi = s3_ids.subtract(webapi_ids)

missing_in_s3.show()  # IDs in SF but missing in S3
missing_in_sf.show()  # IDs in S3 but missing in SF
missing_in_webapi.show()  # IDs in WebAPI but missing in S3
4. Data Quality Checks
Ensure that critical fields (e.g., id, timestamp, or other important fields) are not null and do not contain invalid data.

python
Copy code
# Null checks
null_in_s3 = df_s3.filter(df_s3["id"].isNull() | df_s3["timestamp"].isNull())
null_in_sf = df_sf.filter(df_sf["id"].isNull() | df_sf["timestamp"].isNull())
null_in_webapi = df_webapi.filter(df_webapi["id"].isNull() | df_webapi["timestamp"].isNull())

null_in_s3.show()  # Show records with null values in S3
null_in_sf.show()  # Show records with null values in SF
null_in_webapi.show()  # Show records with null values in WebAPI
5. Data Consistency Checks
Compare specific columns or metrics across data sources to verify that values match, ensuring consistency of data.

python
Copy code
# Assuming 'amount' is a metric to be consistent across sources
inconsistent_data = df_s3.join(df_sf, "id").filter(df_s3["amount"] != df_sf["amount"])

inconsistent_data.show()  # Show inconsistent 'amount' values between S3 and SF
6. Handling Duplicates
Identify and remove any duplicate records to ensure that the extracted data does not contain unintended duplicates.

python
Copy code
# Remove duplicates based on primary key 'id'
df_s3_deduped = df_s3.dropDuplicates(["id"])
df_sf_deduped = df_sf.dropDuplicates(["id"])
df_webapi_deduped = df_webapi.dropDuplicates(["id"])
7. Reconciliation Report
Create a summary of the reconciliation process, including:

Row counts from each source
Number of missing or extra records
Number of null/invalid values
Number of duplicates
python
Copy code
reconciliation_report = {
    "s3_row_count": s3_count,
    "sf_row_count": sf_count,
    "webapi_row_count": webapi_count,
    "missing_in_s3": missing_in_s3.count(),
    "missing_in_sf": missing_in_sf.count(),
    "null_in_s3": null_in_s3.count(),
    "null_in_sf": null_in_sf.count(),
    "duplicates_s3": df_s3.count() - df_s3_deduped.count(),
    "duplicates_sf": df_sf.count() - df_sf_deduped.count()
}

# Print or save the report
print(reconciliation_report)
8. Automating the Reconciliation Process
To ensure consistency and accuracy in the long run, you can automate the reconciliation as part of your pipeline. This can be done by:

Scheduling reconciliation checks after each extraction job completes.
Using PySpark's DataFrame API to generate reconciliation logs.
Incorporating alerts in case of discrepancies using services like AWS CloudWatch or Step Functions to trigger an event.
9. Optimize the Reconciliation Process
Partitioning and Caching: Use partitioning and caching if the data is large to minimize shuffle and improve performance during reconciliation.
Broadcast joins: Use broadcast joins if one of the datasets is small enough to avoid shuffling during key field comparisons.
By following these steps, you can efficiently perform reconciliation in PySpark jobs after extraction from multiple sources (S3, Snowflake, WebAPI).
