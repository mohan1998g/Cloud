Terraform and DAG files in Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) serve entirely different purposes. Here’s a breakdown of what each does and how they fit into MWAA:

1. Terraform
Purpose: Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage cloud resources. In the context of MWAA, Terraform can automate the setup of the entire Airflow environment, including the MWAA environment itself, associated resources like S3 buckets, IAM roles, security groups, and more.
Function in MWAA: Terraform can configure MWAA resources, such as defining the environment, specifying the version of Airflow to use, managing Airflow configurations, and connecting with other AWS services (like S3, RDS, etc.). It does not define the workflows (DAGs) that Airflow runs.
Example Usage: You might use Terraform to create and configure an MWAA environment and set up all dependencies, networking, permissions, etc., before deploying the workflow DAGs.
2. DAG Files
Purpose: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) files in Airflow define the actual workflows. They are Python scripts that specify the tasks, their dependencies, schedules, and logic within Airflow.
Function in MWAA: In MWAA, DAG files are stored in an S3 bucket connected to your MWAA environment. Airflow reads these DAGs to know what tasks to execute, in what order, and when.
Example Usage: A DAG file might define a workflow that performs ETL jobs, data quality checks, or data pipeline orchestration by connecting to various data sources, scheduling tasks, and executing Python scripts or SQL statements.
Key Differences
Terraform: Used for infrastructure setup and provisioning. Controls the configuration of the MWAA environment but does not handle workflow logic.
DAG Files: Used to define workflows within the MWAA environment. Controls the logic and execution flow of tasks managed by Airflow.
Example Scenario
If you’re setting up an MWAA environment, you would:

Use Terraform to automate the creation and configuration of the MWAA environment in AWS.
Write DAG files to define workflows that MWAA will run, which you then upload to the MWAA-associated S3 bucket.
In essence, Terraform sets up the environment, and DAG files define the tasks to run in that environment.
